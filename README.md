# Excel-Replacement-Website
My workout spreadsheet is starting to chug a little, which means that my programmer brain cannot rest until I make a more optimal solution. I might expand this project to work with my other spreadsheets for diet and finances at some point.

I chose the tech stack for the following reasons:
- Go + HTMX for performance and simplicity reasons, in addition to the fact that I really want to get some practice with these technologies
- SQLite because I'm just going to run the server locally anyways, and I want to be able to load the database from a file to give me the flexibility of, say, loading the db from my onedrive.
